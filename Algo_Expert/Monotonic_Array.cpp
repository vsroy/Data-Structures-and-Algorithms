/*Given an array arr[] of N elements where N â‰¥ 2, the task is to check the type of array whether it is:
Increasing.
Decreasing.
Increasing then decreasing.
Decreasing then increasing.*/

/*
Approach: The following conditions must satitisfy for:

Increasing array: The first two and the last two elements must be in increasing order.
Decreasing array: The first two and the last two elements must be in decreasing order.
Increasing then decreasing array: The first two elements must be in increasing order and the last two elements must be in decreasing order.
Decreasing then increasing array: The first two elements must be in decreasing order and the last two elements must be in increasing order.*/
