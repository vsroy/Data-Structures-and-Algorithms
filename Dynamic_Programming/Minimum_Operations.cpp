Double the number
Add one to the number*/
//Solution
/*Instead of going from beginning to destination we can start moving from the destination to initial position and keep track of the cost of jumps.
If N is odd then the only valid move that could lead us here is N-1 to N with a cost of P.
If N is even then we calculate cost of going from N to N/2 position with both the moves and take the minimum of them.
When N equals 0, we return our total calculated cost.*/
